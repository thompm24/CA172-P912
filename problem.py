Now we have a 2d map we can iterate through using y and x coordinates respectively like yx[y][x]

Notice that if we take an intersection of either one of the 2 sets for the top and left values,
there is only a max of one possible rotation for any ABCD cell.

Consider the following:
[positive top] âˆ© [negative left] = [b2,c3]

Therefore, if we have a tile B beneath a positive top, say, c1, and to the right of a negative
left, say, c2, then the only possible rotation of B is b2. However, if the B was instead a D,


The only problem now is that on the far right or far bottom borders, we can not have a positive
left or positive top respectively. This can be solved with an if statement though.
